# WordPress Child Theme
WordPress Child theme that can be used as a basis for modifying any type of WordPress theme. It contains the mandatory functions.php with the needed theme header and the modern way of loading the parent theme CSS and child theme CSS. It also has a style.css where you can add your stylesheet overrides.


##@import is out
@import is no longer used. To quote [Kovshenin](https://konstantin.blog/2014/child-themes-import/):
> "... instead of 200ms, with @import itâ€™ll take the web browser approximately 400ms to load both stylesheets."
